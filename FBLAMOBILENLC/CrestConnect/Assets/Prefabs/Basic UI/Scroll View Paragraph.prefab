    of its essential purpose.



    Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied
    warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
    which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,
    each party''s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.



    "AS
    IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer

    The Service is provided to You "AS IS"
    and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.
    To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
    behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors
    and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties

    trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.



    Some
    jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations
    on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions
    and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
    set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable
    under applicable law.

    the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
